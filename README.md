# CodeAlpha Voice Assistant

Welcome to the CodeAlpha Voice Assistant project! This repository contains a Python-based voice assistant developed as the first task of my internship with CodeAlpha's Python Programming team. The project is designed to showcase the application of Python in creating an interactive voice-enabled software system similar to well-known assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.

Project Overview
The CodeAlpha Voice Assistant is built to understand spoken commands through speech recognition and respond via synthesized voice. The assistant can perform a variety of tasks such as telling the time, checking the internet connection, opening web browsers, and searching the web. It can also learn from interactions to improve its functionality.

Features
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken language into text using the speech_recognition library.
Text to Speech: Converts text responses into spoken audio feedback using the pyttsx3 library.
Interactive Dialogue: Engages with the user in a conversational manner to receive commands and provide the requested information.
Learning Capability: Learns from user inputs to enhance its response accuracy.
Modular Design: Structured with clear modularity for ease of updates and maintenance.
Technologies Used
Python: The entire project is based on Python, utilizing its powerful libraries for processing and operations.
SpeechRecognition: Used for implementing speech-to-text functionality.
pyttsx3: Employs Python's text-to-speech capabilities.
SQLite3: Manages a simple database to store learned commands and responses.
urllib and webbrowser: Used for handling internet-based tasks.
