# CodeAlpha Voice Assistant

Welcome to the CodeAlpha Voice Assistant project! This repository contains a Python-based voice assistant developed as part of my internship with CodeAlpha's Python Programming team. The project aims to demonstrate practical applications of Python in creating interactive, voice-activated systems akin to popular services like Siri and Google Assistant.

## Project Overview

The CodeAlpha Voice Assistant is designed to process spoken commands via speech recognition and provide responses through synthesized speech. Capable of handling tasks such as reporting the time, checking internet connectivity, opening and searching on web browsers, and learning from user interactions to enhance functionality.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- **Text to Speech**: Converts text responses into spoken audio using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Interactive Dialogue**: Engages in conversational interaction to receive commands and deliver requested information.
- **Learning Capability**: Improves response accuracy by learning from user inputs.
- **Modular Design**: Ensures ease of updates and maintenance through a clear modular structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Base programming language for the project.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Implements speech-to-text functionality.
- **pyttsx3**: Provides text-to-speech capabilities.
- **SQLite3**: Manages a lightweight database for storing learned commands and responses.
- **urllib and webbrowser**: Used for internet-based tasks.
